The **Quantum-Enhanced Federated Learning Project** aims to transform predictive diagnostics in healthcare by integrating quantum computing with federated learning frameworks. This project focuses on developing a privacy-preserving federated learning model that utilizes quantum algorithms, such as Quantum Support Vector Machines, to analyze multi-modal healthcare data, including medical images and text. By implementing robust privacy measures like differential privacy and homomorphic encryption, the model ensures the confidentiality of sensitive patient data. The goal is to enhance diagnostic accuracy and interpretability through neuro-symbolic AI, ultimately improving personalized treatment plans and fostering trust among healthcare professionals. This innovative approach addresses critical challenges in handling complex healthcare datasets, paving the way for more effective and efficient medical solutions.
